# Kalman-Filter-Sensor-Integration
This is a repository for Kalman Filter integration for navigational sensors. Code in this repository is spit into two Sub-sections. The paper in this repo describes some of the methods and underlying mathmatics in the code. Much of the code was created for group projects in a Robotics Sensing and Navigation class as well as an individual project for a GNSS signal processing course.

Error state Estimation:
This method was mostly implemeted by Mark Higger in matlab. The code is not complete and does not work, however much of the underlying math is implemeted correctly 

Total State Estimation:
This method was implemented by Joeseph Lynch, Mark Higger and Chen Xu utilizing pre-existing nodes in ROS for Python
